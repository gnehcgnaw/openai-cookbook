    "# How to stream completions\n",
    "# 如何流式传输完成\n",
    "By default, when you request a completion from the OpenAI, the entire completion is generated before being sent back in a single response.\n",
    " 在默认情况下，当您从OpenAI请求完成时，整个完成将在单个响应中生成并发送回来。\n",
    "If you're generating long completions, waiting for the response can take many seconds.\n",
    " 如果您正在生成长的完成，等待响应可能需要很多秒。\n",
    "To get responses sooner, you can 'stream' the completion as it's being generated. This allows you to start printing or processing the beginning of the completion before the full completion is finished.\n",
    " 要更快地获得响应，您可以在生成完成时“流式传输”完成。 这允许您在完成完成之前开始打印或处理完成的开始部分。\n",
    "\n",
    "To stream completions, set `stream=True` when calling the chat completions or completions endpoints. This will return an object that streams back the response as [data-only server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format). Extract chunks from the `delta` field rather than the `message` field.\n",
    " 流式传输完成时，设置`stream=True`时调用聊天完成或完成端点。 这将返回一个对象，该对象将响应作为[仅数据服务器发送事件](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#event_stream_format)流式传输回来。 从`delta`字段而不是`message`字段中提取块。\n",
    "\n",
    "## Downsides\n",
    "## 缺点\n",
    "Note that using `stream=True` in a production application makes it more difficult to moderate the content of the completions, as partial completions may be more difficult to evaluate. which has implications for [approved usage](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines).\n",
    "    请注意，在生产应用程序中使用`stream=True`会使评估完成内容的部分完成更加困难，这对[批准使用](https://beta.openai.com/docs/usage-guidelines)有影响。\n",
    "Another small drawback of streaming responses is that the response no longer includes the `usage` field to tell you how many tokens were consumed. After receiving and combining all of the responses, you can calculate this yourself using [`tiktoken`](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb).\n",
    "    流式响应的另一个小缺点是响应不再包含`usage`字段，以告诉您消耗了多少个令牌。 在接收并组合所有响应之后，您可以使用[`tiktoken`](How_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken.ipynb)自己计算这一点。\n",
